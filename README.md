## Post-install instructions

For the level rank cards to work you'll need to install Roboto. Due to some annoyances with System.Drawing you have to
install it twice in a way.
Steps:

1. Download the font family https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto
2. Extract Roboto-Regular.ttf into the bot's working directory
3. Install Roboto-Regular.ttf on your system

Note: This bot has been modified for use on 64-bit Windows and may not work out of the box. Some modifications
to [`WinBot.csproj`](WinBot.csproj) maybe required.
